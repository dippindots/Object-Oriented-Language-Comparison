# Object Oriented language comparison
1. String comparisons: How are Strings values compared?
2. Null object references: What is the keyword for a null/nil/etc object reference?
3. Name of instance reference in instance method: What is the keyword for referring to an object instance in an instance method? (this/self/?)
4. Name spaces: How are name spaces implemented and used?
### 5. **Errors and exception handling: How are errors and/or exceptions handled/structured/implemented?**

9. Reflection: What reflection abilities are supported?
10. **Procedural programming support: Can functions be created outside of classes or must all functions be methods of a class?**
